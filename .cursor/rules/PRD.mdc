# AI-Powered Cold DM Video Personalization System

**TL;DR:** For B2B salespeople, marketing agencies, and individual entrepreneurs, build an AI-powered video personalization tool so they can replace generic greetings with personalized names using voice synthesis, increasing cold outreach conversion rates.

---

## Users & Value

- **Primary user / persona:** B2B salespeople, marketing agencies, and individual entrepreneurs conducting cold outreach campaigns (20-40 DMs per day) on platforms like LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter.
- **Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD):**
  - When I'm doing cold outreach at scale, I want to personalize my video messages with each prospect's name, so I can increase response rates and stand out from generic messages.
  - When I record a single pitch video, I want to automatically generate personalized versions for multiple prospects, so I can maintain the personal touch without recording individual videos for each contact.

---

## Success Metrics

- **Primary Goal:** Create seamlessly natural-sounding personalized videos where the AI-generated name replacement is indistinguishable from the original speaker's voice.
- **Success Criteria:** Audio seamlessness quality score based on user feedback and A/B testing (target: >90% of users rate the voice replacement as "natural" or "very natural")
